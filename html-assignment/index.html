        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sonia Romero, I'm 32 years old and I'm from Mexico. I was born in <em>Acapulco</em>, a little beach town in the pacific ocean. On my 9<sup>th</sup> birthday, my family moved to <em>Cancun</em>, which is located in the <abbr title="Caribbean Sea">CAR</abbr>. This is where I spent most of my adolescence.</p>
    <p>To be honest, I don't like beach towns. You are <em>constantly</em> sweating because the temperatures are hot and you cannot go to the beach every day (Because you have to go to work). I much prefer the woods and cold rainy climates. This is why I decided to move to Canada and so far I love it. I also enjoy hiking and camping, and those activities seem more enjoyable here in these weather conditions.</p>
